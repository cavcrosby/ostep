# ostep

This is my attempt to self-pace through the book 'Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces' (and to some extent, University of Wisconsin-Madison's CS-537). This repo will serve to document my journey, and to provide others perhaps useful resources I used throughout the book/course. Class resources below are for the instance of the class during Spring 2018.
